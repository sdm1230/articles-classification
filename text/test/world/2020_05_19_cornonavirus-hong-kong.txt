Amid Pandemic, Finding Normalcy in the Abnormal
In a city that is no stranger to outbreaks, life has a way of going on.By Vivian WangPhotographs by Lam Yik FeiHONG KONG —  Two blocks from my apartment on the western edge of Hong Kong Island, a Starbucks has been transformed into what looks like a construction zone, or maybe a strange art installation.An armchair near the window was cordoned off for a time with masking tape, and more strips stretched over and around other chairs nearby, taut like tightropes over their neighboring tabletops. Rectangles of white cardboard are clipped to the sides of tables, which now look more like office cubicles than places to gather with friends.But if the customers are fazed by the oddness of their surroundings, they don’t show it.On a recent Tuesday night, a young couple huddled at one of the tape-free tables, laughing at something on the girl’s phone. A man hunched over his laptop, seemingly oblivious to the silos shielding him from his fellow patrons.Hong Kong was one of the first places outside mainland China to be hit by the coronavirus, and immediately the landscape of the city changed.There were temperature checks at every public building, and signs in elevators telling you how often the buttons were sanitized. A pharmacy chain handed out fistfuls of stickers with every purchase, featuring the chain’s mascot — a winking orange cat — and a reminder: “Wash your hands! Rub your hands! 20 seconds, Thx.”Everywhere, there were reminders that these were not normal times.Four months later, those signs are still around. But the city is humming back to life — not really in spite of those omnipresent reminders so much as alongside them.The attendance for morning tai chi in the park behind my apartment has grown from a few elderly ladies in face masks to dozens. The crowds strolling along Victoria Harbor have grown denser, children giggling behind the plastic visors their parents force on them. Many cha chaan tengs — the hole-in-the-wall Cantonese diners that serve up milk tea, egg tarts and beef chow fun — still offer discounts for takeout, but the tables inside are beginning to fill up, too.Most directly, this is a response to the good news of recent weeks.Hong Kong has recorded just three locally transmitted cases in the last 30 days. Only four people are reported to have died of Covid-19 since the outbreak began. The government has loosened social-distancing restrictions, allowing civil servants to go back to work and restaurants to return to full capacity, instead of half.But that’s not the only reason the virus no longer seems to rule every facet of life here. While fear and anxiety linger, Hong Kongers seem particularly adept at living with those emotions — maybe not embracing this strange new reality, but not recoiling from it either.That unflappability has struck me sharply during my time here.I moved to Hong Kong from New York City three months ago. Before boarding the plane, I had never worn a face mask. Many of my conversations with friends back home revolve around how long it will take for things to go back to the way they were before. Like, really like before — not just without stay-at-home orders and shuttered businesses, but also without masks and the words “social distancing.”In Hong Kong, “real" life doesn’t seem so mutually exclusive with our present one. That’s in no small part because the city has been through this before.Before moving, I read up on Hong Kong’s last battle with an epidemic: SARS. I knew it had been scarred by the disease, which barreled across the city in 2003 and killed almost 300 people. But I didn’t realize how deeply that experience had embedded itself in the city’s psyche until I arrived.Face masks are not uncommon even in outbreak-free times. And Hong Kongers easily remember to press elevator buttons with their keys rather than their fingertips because they have been doing so for years.So when the coronavirus hit, people simply took what they had already been doing and escalated it — sometimes even before the government told them to.They stayed home when they could, and donned masks when they couldn’t. I met many new people in my first weeks in the city; none of them shook my hand. The first time I rode the subway after arriving, I could see down the entire length of the train, a forest of red subway poles with not a single person in sight.Updated May 20, 2020If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.Over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.There is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.Taking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.Paradoxically, this longstanding vigilance and self-restraint have helped Hong Kong preserve some of itself, perhaps more successfully than other cities that have tried to cling to their pre-virus selves. Museums, schools and gyms closed here, but restaurants never had to, nor did hair salons or retail stores.Still, in many ways it’s an illusion. In a city as dense as Hong Kong, even life at half-volume looks vibrant.It’s the balance sheets that reveal the truth.Hong Kong is deep in recession, having just recorded its biggest-ever economic contraction. Restaurants may have stayed open, but they’re floundering. One woman I interviewed in March had quit her job as a security guard to watch her children after schools were closed; they still have not reopened.And, like everyone else in the world, Hong Kongers are tired.Sometimes social distancing gets lip service. At a noodle shop two weeks ago, after the available tables filled up, a waitress deposited a stranger at the table where I was already sitting with two friends. “It’s OK, four people,” she said, referring to the government’s four-person limit on public gatherings. (It has since been raised to eight.)And in Hong Kong, anyway, even the end of the outbreak may not bring true normalcy. Already, the pro-democracy protests that roiled the city for most of last year have begun rekindling, as people feel more comfortable gathering en masse. Many believe they will soon come roaring back.
