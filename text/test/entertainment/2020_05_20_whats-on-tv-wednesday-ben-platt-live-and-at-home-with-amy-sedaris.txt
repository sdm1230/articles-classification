What’s on TV Wednesday: Ben Platt Live and ‘At Home With Amy Sedaris’
By Gabe CohnBEN PLATT LIVE FROM RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL Stream on Netflix. Last month, audiences were given a chance to see a mustachioed Ben Platt perform via webcam as part of a virtual tribute to Stephen Sondheim. See Platt perform on a real stage — and with fuller facial hair — in this concert movie, which was recorded last year at Radio City Music Hall in New York. The set includes music from Platt’s solo album, “Sing to Me Instead,” and covers of songs originally performed by Brandi Carlile, Elton John and Stevie Wonder.HOW TO BUILD A GIRL (2020) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. An awkward British high schooler blossoms into an acid-penned rock critic in “How to Build a Girl,” a coming-of-age comedy from the English director Coky Giedroyc. Adapted by Caitlin Moran from her semi-autobiographical novel of the same title (a New York Times critic called that book “dirtier and funnier than ‘Almost Famous’”), the film casts Beanie Feldstein as Johanna, a 16-year-old in the British Midlands. When it comes to putting words on a page, Johanna has a gift for language — but those linguistic chops don’t extend to face-to-face social interactions, at least at first. Her life — and the plot — gets a jolt when she wins a contest to write for a rock magazine, an opportunity she uses as a chance to reinvent herself. “Like a stone skipping on water, ‘How to Build a Girl’ leaps from raunchy to charming, vulgar to sweet, earthy to airy-fairy without allowing any one to settle,” Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in her review for The Times. “Yet it’s so wonderfully funny and deeply embedded in class-consciousness — ‘We must never forget it’s a miracle when anyone gets anywhere from a bad postcode,’ says one character — that its tonal incontinence is easily forgiven.”AT HOME WITH AMY SEDARIS 10 p.m. on TruTV. Amy Sedaris hosts Michael Cera, Laura Benanti, Jane Krakowski, Paul Rudd and many other celebrity guests in the new, third season of “At Home With Amy Sedaris,” her absurdist sendup of TV home shows. The first episode of the season revolves around child care, with Sedaris’s eccentric characters offering advice for new parents. This involves Sedaris cooking baby food, showing off an inexplicably grotesque fake baby and singing a lullaby about infidelity that rhymes “lipstick on his collar, all men lie” with “come into this world alone, and that’s how you die.”
