Too Big to Fail: The Entire Private Sector
By Matt PhillipsDuring the 2008 financial crisis, Wall Street banks and other big financial institutions were deemed “too big to fail.” The crisis unleashed by the pandemic has broadened that elite status to a significant swath of the American private sector.In a bid to soften the coronavirus’s economic blow, the government has stretched its financial safety net wide — from strategically sensitive companies, to entire industries such as energy and airlines, to the market for corporate bonds.“The ‘too big to fail’ that existed for banks has now extended to a lot of other firms,” said Luigi Zingales, a University of Chicago professor of finance who has long studied the interplay of government, regulation and the private sector.A decade ago, the Federal Reserve was instrumental in keeping the banking system from going bust. This time around, the Fed’s actions are far more sweeping, and it has essentially propped up entire financial markets with its bottomless ability to buy assets with freshly created money.Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, has signaled that the central bank will continue to do so. On Monday, the stock market closed up 3.2 percent, bolstered partly by comments from Mr. Powell, who said there was “really no limit” to what the central bank could do with its emergency lending facilities.“The one thing I can absolutely guarantee is that the Federal Reserve will be doing everything we can to support the people we serve,” Mr. Powell said during a television interview broadcast on Sunday.The market also got a bump on Monday after Moderna, a manufacturer of a potential coronavirus vaccine, reported favorable results in an early trial.While the Fed says it does not seek to keep stock prices up, the market has rebounded some 30 percent since the institution began its giant program to pump trillions of dollars into financial markets. It has bought billions of dollars’ worth of U.S. Treasury bonds and government-insured mortgage bonds, keeping the prices of those bonds up and pushing yields, which move in the opposite direction, down.The Fed also announced recently that it would start to buy exchange-traded funds that hold a diversified portfolio representing large parts of the more than $9 trillion corporate bond market and would move on to buying corporate bonds directly “in the near future.” Since such bonds serve as the basis for new borrowings, this lowers the cost of raising money for corporations tapping the bond markets.“In this cycle, it is not a specific institution that is too big to fail — it is the investment-grade bond market that is too big to fail,” Scott Minerd, global chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners, which has more than $200 billion under management, wrote in a recent client note.The government has also earmarked enormous sums for certain industries. Airlines could receive some $50 billion in loans and aid in the $2 trillion CARES Act. The law set aside around $17 billion “for businesses critical to maintaining national security,” a pot widely seen as being intended for the aerospace and military giant Boeing, which was struggling even before the coronavirus all but halted air travel. (News of the backstop ultimately helped Boeing avoid taking government money, as investors were more confident about lending it money in the bond markets.)These sorts of government actions produce strong feelings, especially among those who say the sink-or-swim discipline of markets that operate without government support leads to a stronger and more dynamic economy. Government involvement risks creating a generation of zombie companies too weak to succeed without Uncle Sam’s help, the argument goes, and interferes with the process of destruction and innovation that makes capitalist economies productive.Could be. But, for investors, such points are largely irrelevant. The bailouts, backstops or safety nets are a reality. That suggests that the conventionally accepted rules of investing are changing. Investors who expect markets to adhere to free-market dogma will quickly find themselves flummoxed by the movement of prices.Exhibit A: the stock market. The S&P 500’s recent rise has appeared increasingly detached from what are usually thought to be the key drivers of equity prices, corporate profits and economic growth. But the romp makes sense if investors account for the trillions of dollars that the Fed has created and pumped into financial markets over the last few months, some of which has wound up migrating to stocks.Updated May 26, 2020If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.Over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.There is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.Taking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.That’s not to say the great backstopping will help only investors. After all, government support typically comes with plenty of political strings attached.After the 2008 financial crisis led to bailouts of large parts of the financial sector, a renewed regulatory push limited the ability of banks to take big risks and maximize profits. That protected taxpayers, but muted the rates of return on financial stocks.Mr. Zingales said that this time around, regulations could begin to limit share repurchases, which have boomed in recent years and helped support stock prices. Over the last decade, American corporations have emerged as the biggest net buyers of the stock market, providing a crucial source of demand for shares. Buybacks have also shrunk the supply of shares available to be purchased by other investors. And since investors often value stocks based on profits per share, reducing the number of shares makes it easier to keep per-share growth numbers high enough to attract investors.The surge in buybacks has received plenty of criticism in recent years, especially from the political left. But Mr. Zingales said he had largely been unsympathetic to such concerns until recently. With the government showing it is willing to ensure the survival of some companies, share repurchases are no longer a matter that concerns the corporation and its shareholders — especially if those same companies that spent large amounts of cash on buybacks turn to taxpayers for help when the going gets tough.For instance, Boeing, which the government was willing to support with billions of assistance, spent about $35 billion to buy back its shares between 2015 and 2019.
