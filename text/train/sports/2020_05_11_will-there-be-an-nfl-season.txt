Can the N.F.L. Really Return to Normal This Fall?
By Ken Belson and Joe WardEven as the coronavirus continued to ravage American communities, the N.F.L. last week released a full schedule of games that on the surface included no obvious backup plan in case the pandemic prevents the season from starting on Sept. 10.But the odds that the league will be able to keep to its schedule are decreasing by the day. Before games can be played, teams must first open their offices and training facilities, which have been shut since mid-March, then hold training camps, which are to begin in mid-July.To keep what they call “competitive equity,” league executives say teams can reopen their offices and training facilities only when it is safe for every team to do so. The N.F.L. is also requiring its teams, scattered across two dozen states, to follow local and state guidelines, including frequent testing and limits on the size of gatherings, to determine when it will be safe enough for coaches, staff and players to return.Here is the current rate of reported cases in states where N.F.L. teams have facilities, which have been shut down since mid-March.States where new cases are:increasingmostly the samedecreasingTeams’ facilitiesSeahawksPackersPatriotsVikingsBillsLionsGiantsSteelersJetsBearsBrownsEaglesRavens49ersColtsRedskinsBroncosBengalsRaidersChiefsRamsPanthersTitansCardinalsChargersFalconsCowboysJaguarsSaintsTexansBuccaneersDolphinsData is from a New York Times database and is as of May 10, 2020.States are grouped according to how the seven-day average of new cases has changed from a week ago.States where new cases are:increasingmostly the samedecreasingTeams’ facilitiesSeahawksPackersPatriotsVikingsBillsLionsGiantsSteelersJetsBrownsBearsEaglesRavens49ersColtsRedskinsBroncosBengalsRaidersChiefsRamsPanthersTitansCardinalsChargersFalconsCowboysJaguarsSaintsTexansBuccaneersDolphinsData is from a New York Times database and is as of May 10, 2020.States are grouped according to how the seven-day average of new cases has changed from a week ago.States where new cases are:increasingmostly the samedecreasingTeams’ facilitiesSeahawksPackersPatriotsBillsVikingsLionsGiantsEaglesBearsJetsBrownsSteelers49ersRavensColtsRedskinsBroncosBengalsRaidersChiefsRamsPanthersCardinalsTitansChargersFalconsCowboysJaguarsSaintsTexansBuccaneersDolphinsData is from a New York Times database and is as of May 10, 2020.States are grouped according to how the seven-day average of new cases has changed from a week ago.States where new cases are:increasingmostly the samedecreasingSEAMINGBNEBUFDETNYGPHICHINYJCLEBALPITSFWASDENINDCINLVKCLARCARARITENLACATLDALJACNOHOUTBMIAData is from a New York Times database and is as of May 10, 2020.States are grouped according to how the seven-day average of new caseshas changed from a week ago.By The New York TimesTrying to forecast when that will be is difficult. State and local restrictions have been changing rapidly, and human behavior — how many people within a population will travel across state lines, for example — is hard to predict, epidemiologists said. Estimating how conditions will change in the two dozen states in which N.F.L. teams are based — and where the number of cases is rising and falling at different rates and at different times — is far more complex.“The reality is when we look at the numbers there’s substantial uncertainty in the predictions,” said Gerardo Chowell, the chairman of the Department of Population Health Sciences at Georgia State’s School of Public Health in Atlanta. “Even looking six or eight weeks ahead is very difficult right now.”To understand the hurdles in the way of the N.F.L.’s return, Chowell reviewed the number of infections since Jan. 21, when the first Covid-19 infection was reported in the United States, as compiled by The New York Times. The data, sorted by county, shows a wide variety of conditions, with the virus devastating big cities and small communities alike, largely disappearing in some places and refusing to leave others. New hot spots are emerging in places once considered safe.Here are the number and rate of growth of coronavirus cases in counties and parishes where N.F.L. team facilities are located.PER100,000PEOPLESLOWERFASTERFACILITY LOCATION(COUNTY, STATE)COVID-19CASESCASE GROWTH RATETEAMFEB 26MAY 9CardinalsFalconsRavensBillsPanthersBearsBengalsBrownsCowboysBroncosLionsPackersTexansColtsJaguarsChiefsChargersRamsRaidersDolphinsVikingsPatriotsSaintsGiantsJetsSteelersEagles49ersSeahawksBuccaneersTitansRedskinsMaricopa, Ariz.Hall, Ga.Baltimore, Md.Erie, N.Y.Mecklenburg, N.C.Lake, Ill.Hamilton, OhioCuyahoga, OhioDenton, TexasArapahoe, Colo.Wayne, Mich.Brown, Wis.Harris, TexasMarion, Ind.Duval, Fla.Kansas City* Orange, Calif.Los Angeles, Calif.Clark, Nev.Broward, Fla.Hennepin, Minn.Norfolk, Mass.Jefferson, La.Bergen, N.J.Morris, N.J.Allegheny, Pa.Philadelphia, Pa.Santa Clara, Calif.King, Wash.Hillsborough, Fla.Davidson, Tenn.Loudoun, Va.5,8272,0093,8784,4532,0745,1991,7572,7959143,228	17,960	1,8347,8037,4051,1647673,50631,2684,7045,8583,5586,8876,709	16,9295,8541,503	18,211	2,317	7,3191,432	3,6521,1591371,0254694841977392162231135071,0207061707841261591113102203072889861,5411,8201,1841231,156121338104534301 Growth rate shows how frequently the number of cases has doubled over the previous seven days.

Charts are through May 9, 2020. *Data for Kansas City, Mo. is reported at the city level.By The New York TimesBergen County, N.J., Philadelphia County and Wayne County, Mich., where the Giants, the Eagles and the Detroit Lions are based, are among the hardest hit areas, having seen a large number of cases over all and a high number of cases per capita. In Brown County, Wis., a smaller community that is home to the Green Bay Packers, cases doubled about every three days in early April but have since slowed. The rate of increase in cases in King County, Wash., home to the Seattle Seahawks, peaked in March and has been declining since.These statistics, though, may understate the actual number of cases because available testing is limited. The number of cases is rising in some states that have loosened their stay-at-home restrictions. One model used by the Trump administration projected the number of daily deaths in the United States to reach about 3,000 by June 1, a 70 percent increase from current numbers, according to an internal document obtained by The New York Times. By most estimates, a vaccine against the Covid-19 virus is many months away.Still, compared with other professional leagues, which shut down midseason, the N.F.L. has had time to prepare. While the N.B.A. scrambled to close, the N.F.L. forged ahead with free agency in March and its draft in April, albeit remotely. The league turned the release of its 2020 schedule into a three-hour, prime-time TV event.Despite its resolve, the N.F.L. is starting to acknowledge that the virus may derail its plans to open the season on time and in front of fans. The league moved its international games back to the United States. Before announcing the new schedule, league and team officials contacted officials in their states to let them know that contingencies had been made in case games must be postponed or canceled. The Jets said they would not sell single-game tickets, which may reduce overcrowding at MetLife Stadium if games are played in front of fans. Tom Garfinkel, the president of the Miami Dolphins, unveiled plans to play games at Hard Rock Stadium in front of 15,000 fans, or about a quarter of capacity.Last week, Roger Goodell, the N.F.L. commissioner, sent club executives guidelines for how to reopen their facilities gradually, at first to only staff and coaches. No more than 50 percent of employees can be in the building at once. Employees should work in shifts to minimize contact. Every club must create an infection response team, encourage continued telecommuting work policies and discourage nonessential travel.“It is impossible to predict what the next few months will bring,” Goodell wrote. The league, he added, “will be prepared to address any contingencies as they arise.”Next would be plans for the return of players to the facilities. The league is working with infectious disease physicians from Duke and other experts, and speaking with the N.F.L. Players Association about how and when they can return.“We have to proceed with a tremendous amount of caution,” DeMaurice Smith, the executive director of the union, told reporters two weeks ago. Making predictions is difficult “because there are so many variables we would have to control for and so many variables we don’t know.”Smith declined to quantify the comfort of players in regard to returning to team facilities. But some players said they were nervous they could be infected.Updated May 26, 2020If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.Over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.There is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.Taking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.“I think for us it doesn’t make any sense to play games unless it’s completely, 100 percent safe for us to go out there,” Kareem Jackson, a 10-year veteran who plays for the Denver Broncos, told reporters. “If there’s any threat of us being able to contract Covid in any way and spread it to our families or anybody else, it just doesn’t make sense.”It is impossible to eliminate the risk of infection if players congregate. But there are ways to reduce the risk of infection by sequestering, testing and other steps. Teams could isolate players and coaches, even from their families, inside closed facilities. Or players and staff could return to their homes at night and be encouraged to stay in.Playing in stadiums without fans is no guarantee against the risk of infection, either, as the Ultimate Fighting Championship found out Saturday, when it canceled a bout after a fighter and two of his cornermen tested positive for the virus.“It’s difficult for me to imagine what the league and, broadly, leagues do when one or two of their key personnel or players have tested positive,” Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, who has said it will be many months before fans fill stadiums in his state, told reporters last week. “Do they quarantine the rest of the team? If an offensive lineman is practicing with a defensive lineman, and they have tested positive, what happens to the rest of the line? What happens to the game coming up the next weekend?”Even if teams are sequestered, injured players may need to go to a hospital, which are hotbeds for the infection. Players acquired in a trade or through free agency may need to be quarantined before joining their new team. Extra steps will be needed to protect teams traveling to away games. The number of cases is expected to spike in the fall and winter, in the heart of the N.F.L. season.
