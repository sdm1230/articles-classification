Tom Brady Reportedly Moves Into Derek Jeter’s Tampa Estate
By Victor MatherIf you’re Tom Brady, you suddenly need a place to live in the Tampa area. And if you’re Tom Brady, a one-bedroom is probably not an option.So where else to turn but Derek Jeter’s mansion? The Tampa Bay Times reported that Brady was moving into a cozy bungalow owned by Jeter on Davis Islands in Tampa.The New York Times described the house in 2011. At 30,875 square feet, it has seven bedrooms, nine bathrooms, a pool, two boat lifts, a drive-through portico and two three-car garages.Jeter himself is now more of a Miami guy, serving as chief executive of the Marlins. Brady, a Michigan alumnus, and Jeter, who committed to Michigan before going pro, are longtime friends.In 2005 and 2006, Jeter’s development company bought two adjacent lots, paying $7.7 million, in order to give his humble home room to breathe. Construction started in 2010.
