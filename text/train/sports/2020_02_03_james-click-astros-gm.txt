By The Associated PressHOUSTON — The Houston Astros hired James Click as their new general manager Monday, putting the former Tampa Bay Rays executive in charge of the scandal-ridden team a week before the start of spring training.Click succeeds Jeff Luhnow, who along with manager A.J.

The 42-year-old Click had been with Tampa Bay for the last 14 seasons.“I am excited to join the Astros family,” Click said in a statement. “The Astros are a progressive and innovative organization with a deeply talented group in the front office.”The Rays beat Oakland in the American League wild-card game and pushed Houston to five games before falling in Game 5 in their division series. Tampa Bay’s senior vice president of baseball operations, Chaim Bloom, was hired as chief baseball officer by the Boston Red Sox in late October.“The departure of another talented, senior Rays executive is difficult,” the Tampa Bay owner Stuart Sternberg said in a statement. “That difficulty is compounded by the timing of the departure, only days from the opening of spring training.”“A large number of former Rays staffers now populate senior team positions across the league. Most recently, two of the past three World Series winning teams, against whom we compete directly, have reached beyond their organizations and into our ranks to fill their top baseball operations positions,” he said.Click was set to be formally introduced by the Astros at a news conference on Tuesday at Minute Maid Park.“James has had an impressive career,” Crane said in a statement. “He is a respected leader who has progressed in this game across all aspects of baseball operations and he has built great relationships with both front office and clubhouse personnel.”Click graduated from Yale and wrote for the analytics website Baseball Prospectus for several years before being hired by the Rays.Click was involved in guiding and overseeing all aspects of the baseball operations department. His areas of focus were research and development, strategic planning and innovation.Luhnow and Hinch were suspended for a year by Commissioner Rob Manfred on Jan. 13 after an M.L.B. investigation found that the Astros had used electronics to illicitly steal signs during their run to the 2017 World Series championship and again in the 2018 season. Crane announced hours later that Luhnow and Hinch were fired.The Astros also were fined $5 million, the maximum allowed under M.L.B. rules, and forfeited their next two first- and second-round amateur draft picks.
