Supreme Court Asked to Suspend Wealth Test for Green Cards in Light of Virus
By Adam LiptakWASHINGTON — Three states asked the Supreme Court on Monday to revisit a January ruling that allowed the Trump administration to move forward with plans to deny green cards to immigrants who make even occasional and minor use of public benefits like Medicaid.New York, Connecticut and Vermont, along with New York City, asked the justices to temporarily suspend the program in light of the coronavirus pandemic.“Every person who doesn’t get the health coverage they need today risks infecting another person with the coronavirus tomorrow,” said Letitia James, New York’s attorney general. “Immigrants provide us with health care, care for our elderly, prepare and deliver our food, clean our hospitals and public spaces and take on so many other essential roles in our society, which is why we should all be working to make testing and health coverage available to every single person in this country, regardless of immigration status.”The pandemic, the motion said, had changed the legal calculus and justified loosening the administration’s new requirements for the so-called public charge rule, which allows officials to deny permanent legal status, also known as a green card.“By deterring immigrants from accessing publicly funded health care, including programs that would enable immigrants to obtain testing and treatment for Covid-19,” the motion said, “the rule makes it more likely that immigrants will suffer serious illness if infected and spread the virus inadvertently to others — risks that are heightened because immigrants make up a large proportion of the essential workers who continue to interact with the public.”The motion acknowledged that the administration had posted a notice relaxing aspects of its new program, but it said that the notice was confusing and inadequate. The notice said treatment for symptoms that resemble those of the coronavirus “will not negatively affect any alien as part of a future public charge analysis.”The notice added that officials would consider “relevant and credible” explanations, supported by documentation, for reliance on public benefits by immigrants who could not work or go to school because of the pandemic.The motion filed on Monday said the notice “does not fully address the grave harms that the rule is causing during the ongoing pandemic.” For instance, the motion said, an applicant for a green card who seeks “federally funded Medicaid will have that application count against him in the public charge inquiry, even if subsequently obtained Covid-19 treatment paid for by federally funded Medicaid does not itself count in the public charge inquiry.”“Placing immigrants in a situation where they must choose between forgoing essential aid for health care, food or housing or risking their future chances of obtaining” lawful permanent residence status, the motion said, “is particularly inequitable during this unprecedented moment in our history, and will inhibit the country’s ability to recover from the current economic crisis.”The motion asked the court to suspend its ruling until the emergency passed. In the alternative, it asked the justices to allow a trial judge to take a new look at the case in light of the pandemic.The administration announced in August that it would revise the public charge rule for immigrants who are likely to need public assistance. In the past, only substantial and sustained monetary help or long-term institutionalization counted, and fewer than 1 percent of applicants were disqualified on public charge grounds.
