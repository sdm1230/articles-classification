The Pioneering Black Historian Who Was Almost Erased From History
Friday: Remembering Delilah L. Beasley, an Oakland Tribune columnist who documented black pioneers in California. Also: The presidential candidates hit the Inland Empire.By Jill CowanBy Jill CowanGood morning.(Don’t get California today delivered to your inbox? Here’s the sign-up.)It’s Black History Month, which is a good time to reflect on whose stories are repeated or forgotten, whose work is celebrated and why.So today we’re highlighting the work of Delilah L. Beasley, an important — but largely unsung — black historian, a woman who spent years traveling the state to document black life in California.In the Bay Area, Ms. Beasley might be best known for her work as an Oakland Tribune columnist — the first black woman to hold such a role at a major metropolitan newspaper.But Dana Johnson, a writer and University of Southern California associate professor, said she was fascinated by another of Ms. Beasley’s achievements: her book, “Negro Trail Blazers of California,” published in 1919.“She was the person who did all this work by herself with no formal training as a historian,” Ms. Johnson said.[See how California’s and Texas’s history textbooks differ and what we can learn from that.]Ms. Johnson wrote a fictionalized short story about Ms. Beasley for a new book, “Trailblazer: Delilah Beasley’s California,” published by the L.A. arts organization Clockshop and the Huntington Library as part of an exhibition exploring and challenging the idea of Utopia.The story is told from Ms. Beasley’s perspective, as a kind of imagined, impressionistic memoir. Ms. Johnson said one reason she took that approach was that so little is known about Ms. Beasley’s life.“The irony was that someone who concerned herself with making sure African-Americans in this country were not erased from history was herself erased from the historical narrative,” she said.The new book also includes a more straightforward biography, by Ana Cecilia Alvarez, pieced together from scant source material: Ms. Beasley was born in Ohio in 1867. She started writing for newspapers at age 12, but her name did not appear in print until the Sept. 10, 1887, issue of the African-American weekly The Cleveland Gazette.She was orphaned as a teenager and worked as a maid, a nurse and a massage therapist. In 1910, she made California her home, becoming “one among a significant western migration of black Americans in search of an honest fulfillment of citizenship’s promise at the turn of the century,” according to the book.[Read about Biddy Mason, a black woman who helped build Los Angeles.]Ms. Beasley found thriving black civic, social and religious institutions in Oakland, even as African-Americans faced much of the same profound discrimination there as elsewhere in the country.“She saw California as this magical utopian place,” Ms. Johnson said, “but she was also very sharp-eyed about those contradictions.”Ms. Beasley became obsessive about documenting the history of African-Americans in the West. She wrote about slavery in California, which was supposed to be a free state. She wrote about the first African-American detective she had ever heard of, and told of black firefighters.At the time, Ms. Johnson said, Ms. Beasley’s insistence on laying out everything she could find about the accomplishments of the pioneers she profiled in her book proved “to some critics’ minds, too much detail.”Ms. Johnson said she was struck by that urgency — how it took a toll on Ms. Beasley’s health, how she must have toiled to have an outlet for a relentlessly curious mind.“I was born in 1967 — exactly 100 years apart — and her concerns are my concerns,” Ms. Johnson said. “That’s why I write.”You can see the exhibition, “Beside the Edge of the World,” at the Huntington Library, Art Museum and Botanical Gardens until Feb. 24.And you can learn more about Ms. Beasley at the Oakland Public Library.We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.
