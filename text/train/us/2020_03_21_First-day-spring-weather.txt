Storm Expected to Bring Snow to the Northeast on Monday
By Johnny DiazWinter may be officially over but the first few days of spring are expected to bring storms with a mix of rain and snow from coast to coast.A nor’easter is forecast to bring snow to the Mid-Atlantic States and parts of the Northeast on Monday, including Northern New York and Western Massachusetts, the National Weather Service said. Expect a “raw day” with cold rain and snow and as much as six inches of snow in the mountains, the service said.“The best chance for impactful snow is across interior southern New England, especially the Worcester Hills and slopes of the Berkshires,’’ the Weather Service of Boston said on Twitter.A slow-moving storm system off the California coast is expected to push eastward, bringing wet weather late on Sunday afternoon into Sunday evening to parts of Central and Southern California.Strong storms and heavy rain are also possible across South Texas to the Lower Mississippi Valley, while some showers are expected to extend farther north on Saturday and Sunday, according to the Weather Service.The first full day of the spring season was Friday.“It’s spring so we are in a transitional period,” said Matthew Wunsch, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in New York. “Especially in New York, you are going to get fairly decent temperature swings. As systems move across from the west to east, they kind of will intensify.”The high in New York City was 77 degrees on Friday, he said.The New York metropolitan area, including northeastern New Jersey, will see temperatures 20 to 30 degrees lower on Saturday, with highs in the lower 50s, as cooler air moves in from the northwest.Sunday in the metro New York area is expected to be sunny with highs in the mid 40s. The forecast calls for a chance of snow on Monday morning, with snow likely in the afternoon but with little or no accumulation. Highs are expected to be in the lower 40s.“It will gradually get really warm and then it will get really cold again” over the spring, Mr. Wunsch said.About three to six inches of snow is expected across the Poconos in Pennsylvania and northwestern New Jersey on Sunday night and into Monday.“Even though it will snow in some areas, it will be hard to accumulate on the ground because it’s been warm,’’ Mr. Wunsch said.The last time the Weather Service office in New York issued a winter weather advisory was Feb. 6 and it was for freezing rain and sleet for areas just north of New York City.
