Sign up here.More companies are temporarily halting business in parts of China, as the outbreak spreads and the fear of contagion rises.Here’s the latest:• British Airways suspended flights to and from mainland China. Cathay Pacific and United Airlines have reduced the number of flights.• Starbucks closed more than half of its stores in the country, its second-biggest market.• The owner of Uniqlo has closed about 100 stores in the affected Hubei Province.Apple said the outbreak could affect its financial forecasts. Tim Cook, its C.E.O., told analysts yesterday that suppliers could be disrupted and that traffic to its stores in China had dropped.The moves come as the disease’s toll continues to grow.  The death tally as of this morning was 132 — up from 106 yesterday — and the number of cases jumped 25 percent, to 5,974. And more cases are being reported of people in other countries falling ill, despite having not visited China.Markets offered a mixed reaction. Hong Kong stocks fell today, their first day of trading after the Lunar New Year holiday. But S&P futures are indicating a positive opening in the U.S.Britain, defying calls from the White House to block Huawei products, said it would not ban the Chinese company from being used in its new high-speed 5G wireless network.Prime Minister Boris Johnson allowed Huawei technology to be used in some parts of Britain’s 5G infrastructure, though not in essential ones. And “high risk” vendors who pose potential security risks wouldn’t be allowed to hold more than 35 percent of the country’s overall network.The decision dismissed the Trump administration’s claims that using Huawei products could compromise the security of 5G systems.Britain is in a tough position: Washington threatened to withhold intelligence if London allowed Huawei into the country’s 5G network, while China threatened economic retaliation if it didn’t.The decision could embolden other countries to use Huawei. Canada and Germany are set to decide this year on whether to block the Chinese company.A Trump administration official said the U.S. was “disappointed” by the move and would work with Britain “on a way forward that results in the exclusion of untrusted vendor components from 5G networks.”The Fed is expected to announce a decision on interest rates today after the end of its latest board meeting. That will again put the focus on Mr. Powell, the chairman, who continues to face pressure from President Trump as he steers the central bank, Jeanna Smialek of the NYT writes.• “Everything about him, from the simple language he uses at news conferences to his demeanor on Capitol Hill, conveys that he is relatable, ordinary and decidedly undramatic,” Ms. Smialek writes of the Fed chairman.• His quiet approach “is part of a deeper strategy by Mr. Powell, who is trying to convince America that the Fed is a collection of nonpartisan public servants focused on serving the American people — not a temple of elites wielding unchecked power.”• “To shore up support, Mr. Powell visits Capitol Hill frequently, holding more than 260 meetings with members of Congress since taking over as chair in February 2018.”That approach is repeatedly tested by Mr. Trump’s criticism that the Fed has kept interest rates too high. Yesterday, the president tweeted that the central bank “should get smart” and lower rates.But Mr. Powell and the Fed are expected to keep rates steady and to continue to do so until the economic picture changes.Prosecutors arrested Charles Lieber, a top scientist at Harvard, charging him with concealing financial ties to China. It’s an escalation in a campaign to stamp out the stealing of secrets from U.S. universities, Ellen Barry of the NYT writes.• Dr. Lieber, who specializes in nanoscale electronics, is not accused of sharing sensitive information with Chinese officials. But he was charged with hiding how much money Chinese funders were paying him. (It was tens of thousands of dollars a year, according to prosecutors.)• He was ensnared in a two-year push by the Justice Department to find individuals at U.S. universities working with the Chinese government. Massachusetts, with its many universities, is a “target-rich” environment, according to the special agent in charge of the F.B.I.’s Boston field office.• The drive has meant “researchers are adjusting to a higher level of scrutiny about foreign funding than they faced in the past,” Ms. Barry writes.The money-management firm State Street plans to vote against directors of companies in major stock indexes that fall behind targets for environmental, social and governance changes.“We see that shareholder value is increasingly being driven by issues such as climate change, labor practices and consumer product safety,” Cyrus Taraporevala, the C.E.O. of the firm’s investment management arm, wrote in a letter to corporate boards.State Street will start its campaign with companies in the S&P 500 and in major European indexes, and then broaden the effort in 2022.The decision matters, given State Street’s size. Its Global Advisors division oversees $3.1 trillion in assets and is a major investor in companies around the world.The big picture: Increasingly, huge money managers are using their influence to push for changes beyond financial performance. BlackRock, which has over $7 trillion in assets, said this month that it would make climate change a key investment focus.Today brings a first for the 151-year-old bank: an “investor day” for shareholders, as well as for analysts, the news media and even regulators.The event is an attempt to promote a more open image for a company that has traditionally been known as a secretive black box of profits and “an adrenaline-fueled sales-and-trading juggernaut,” Kate Kelly of the NYT writes.Goldman’s C.E.O., David Solomon, will argue that the bank has evolved. The firm has jumped into retail banking and credit cards, for example, and it does more mundane tasks like manage cash for corporations.Updated May 26, 2020If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.Over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.There is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.Taking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.But some executives reportedly think the firm is trying too hard. “They want the investor day to focus more on places where Goldman actually makes money,” Laura Noonan of the FT writes, citing unnamed sources.Mr. Solomon has his work cut out. Goldman “is to some extent grasping at straws strategically,” one investor specializing in financial stocks told Ms. Noonan.Deals• The investment firm Platinum Equity has reportedly tried to poach Joe Ianniello, the head of CBS, to lead its takeover bid for Univision.
