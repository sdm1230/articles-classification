How to Fight That Sinking Feeling
 By my count, I have given 53 elbow bumps in the past 72 hours. During that time, I’ve turned down several dozen handshakes and tried, unsuccessfully, to turn this into a thing as the coronavirus spreads. (Want this in your inbox each morning? Sign up here.)Over the weekend, the global death toll of the coronavirus surpassed 3,000, with about 90,000 identified cases in 65 countries. The U.S. reported its first two deaths from the virus, both in a Seattle suburb, while New York City disclosed its first case. The latest developments, as always, can be found in our live briefing.Stocks can also go up — sometimes. A rare sight in recent days, markets in Asia and Europe posted gains in early trading, recovering some of the ground lost during last week’s rout. (European shares are mixed at the time of writing, and U.S. futures have tipped into the red.) The turnaround, such as it is, began when Bank of Japan issued a statement pledging support to “ensure stability in financial markets,” echoing a similar notice from the Federal Reserve on Friday. Jittery markets are expecting increasingly aggressive, potentially coordinated actions from central banks around the world. (Anybody else getting 2008 flashbacks?)“This virus doesn’t care what the Fed does,” an investor told the NYT’s Matt Phillips. But something is better than nothing, and that could be the simple narrative behind the buying today. Even after the recent correction, U.S. stocks are trading at relatively high valuations, as measured by things like the price-to-earnings, or P/E, ratio. The hit that corporate earnings will take as a result of the virus outbreak is a matter of much debate — and if it proves worse than expected, then the “P” will follow the “E” down, possibly much further down.It’s all about the scenarios, with forecasters building out their models for how the virus might affect economies. Today, the O.E.C.D. updated its economic forecast, cutting its expectation for global growth this year by half a percentage point, to 2.4 percent. But in the worst-case “domino scenario,” a widespread outbreak could push global growth to 1.5 percent, the worst result since — you guessed it — the 2008 financial crisis.What’s next? Although some market technicians think the sell-off is far from over, most of the research and commentary that’s landed on our desks thinks the market will soon find its feet. The recent selling has “the look of revulsion about it,” notes Bloomberg’s John Authers, which is the polite way of describing what traders call the “puke point,” suggesting that a rally is in store. How queasy are you feeling? Let us know.We will be tracking all the day’s market moves in a special live briefing. The activist hedge fund Elliott Management’s latest big bet is a $1 billion stake in Twitter, with the goal of shaking up the social network’s leadership. Michael did some reporting over the weekend on why the $40 billion hedge fund run by Paul Singer has set its sights on Twitter’s founder, Jack Dorsey.Mr. Dorsey’s dual C.E.O. roles at Twitter and at Square, the financial services provider, have been a longtime concern among investors who worry about his attention span. (How many listed tech companies can you run simultaneously?)Other things weighing on Elliott’s mind:• Twitter’s total enterprise value is just $22.5 billion, despite being one of the most prominent internet companies around. By comparison, Facebook’s is $504 billion, and even the old-internet company eBay has an enterprise value of $33 billion. Elliott thinks Mr. Dorsey and his leadership team have not focused enough on innovation, according to people briefed on the matter.• Twitter’s leadership has seen a lot of turnover in recent years, particularly in the C.O.O. and C.F.O. roles.• Far more of Mr. Dorsey’s wealth is tied up in Square than Twitter. He owns about 13 percent of Square’s outstanding shares, valued at $4.9 billion as of Friday, while he controls about 2 percent of Twitter’s outstanding shares, valued at about $531 million.• He may view Twitter as less important. In an interview with Rolling Stone last year, he said of Twitter versus Square, “If you lose 140 characters, people are like, ‘Eh.’ If you lose $140 or even $1.40, it’s important.”The Finnish telecom equipment giant is replacing its C.E.O. after falling behind in the race to bring out 5G wireless technology.Rajeev Suri, the current C.E.O., failed to make headway in 5G during his half-decade tenure, falling behind Huawei and a Swedish rival, Ericsson, in securing new deals with telecom operators. That’s despite the Trump administration’s touting Nokia as one of the best hopes to blunt Huawei’s edge in the market.Shares in Nokia have fallen more than a third during Mr. Suri’s time as C.E.O. Mr. Suri will be replaced by Pekka Lundmark, the C.E.O. of the Finnish power utility Fortnum.🇮🇱 Voters in Israel head to the polls today for the third general election in less than a year.🇬🇧🇪🇺Also today, trade talks formally begin between Britain and the E.U. in Brussels. The two sides are far apart on the goals of their post-Brexit relationship.🇺🇸 Super Tuesday in the Democratic presidential primaries is on, er, Tuesday, with about a third of all delegates up for grabs in a diverse batch of 14 states. Joe Biden could get a boost because the fellow moderate Pete Buttigieg dropped out over the weekend, but Bernie Sanders remains the front-runner, and businesses are worried.🛢 A two-day meeting of OPEC members starts on Thursday, with a bigger-than-expected production cut on the cards, as the coronavirus outbreak has led to an oil price slump.📈 The U.S. jobs report is out on Friday, with most analysts expecting another strong result for February hiring.Updated May 26, 2020If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.Over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.There is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.Taking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.🛍 Throughout the week, a number of retailers will report earnings, including Target, Costco, Kroger, Abercrombie & Fitch, and Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. Analysts will probably quiz execs on whether they are seeing sales slow as a result of the coronavirus.
