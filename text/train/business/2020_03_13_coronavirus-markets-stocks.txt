After the Market’s Worst Day in Decades, Where Do We Go From Here?
 It’s Friday the 13th. Stay safe out there. (Want this in your inbox each morning? Sign up here.)Trillions of dollars in market value were erased on Thursday — $4.7 trillion, to be exact, per S&P Dow Jones Indices — after several global exchanges suffered their steepest fall since the Black Monday crash of 1987.It has been worse. The roughly 10 percent drop in U.S. indexes yesterday was only half as bad as the daily drop on Oct. 19, 1987. Feel better? Didn’t think so.The S&P 500 is back to where it was in January 2019. Other markets have retrenched even further. Here’s the last time we saw markets trade at the depths of Thursday’s close:🇺🇸 S&P 500: January 2019🇨🇦 S&P/TSX Composite: February 2016🇬🇧 FTSE 100: November 2011🇩🇪 DAX: February 2016🇫🇷 CAC 40: June 2016🇮🇹 FTSE/MIB: November 2012🇯🇵 Nikkei 225: November 2016Much of the gains made since President Trump took office have evaporated. His approval rating tends to move in line with the markets, an association that he often encourages. In mid-February, the S&P 500 was up nearly 60 percent since the 2016 election and 50 percent higher than the day of Mr. Trump’s inauguration. Now, the index is 16 percent higher than Election Day and 9 percent above inauguration levels. (His approval rating is  around 42 percent.)• The S&P 500 is down 23 percent since Mr. Trump tweeted in late February, “Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”Things are looking up today. Asian markets initially followed Wall Street’s plunge, but pared their losses as central banks stepped in to provide emergency liquidity (more on that below). European stocks opened higher, and U.S. futures suggested a rise on Wall Street as well — but not nearly enough to recoup yesterday’s losses.Some humor (at crypto’s expense), from Paul Donovan of UBS: “The S&P fell 27% from its highs — it is up 38% converted into bitcoin. People should not convert into bitcoin.”The Fed announced $1.5 trillion in short-term loans for banks during yesterday’s market meltdown, hoping to settle nerves about potential stresses in credit markets and other crucial bits of financial plumbing.“The Fed just brought an aircraft carrier to a knife fight,” Gennadiy Goldberg of TD Securities told Bloomberg. Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote in a research note: “This is a full-blown crisis response operation, intended to make it abundantly clear that the Fed will not allow liquidity to dry up.” Analysts at Goldman Sachs now expect the Fed to cut its benchmark rate a full percentage point at its meeting next week.• The European Central Bank also introduced emergency stimulus measures yesterday, but the steps underwhelmed the markets.• Central banks in Australia, Japan, South Korea and elsewhere announced stimulus measures today for their strained banking systems.“Now it’s up to Congress to fire the fiscal bazooka,” Mr. Shepherdson added. (What is it about analysts and military metaphors?)• Congress is close to a deal offering enhanced unemployment benefits, free virus testing, aid for food assistance programs and federal funds for Medicaid, the NYT reports. A vote on the package is expected today.• Christine Lagarde, the president of the E.C.B., bemoaned “the complacency and slow-motion process” of governments in the eurozone, hoping to encourage fiscal stimulus.• “Investors may be starting to contemplate a world in which financial morphine no longer functions,” wrote Gillian Tett of the FT. In other words: Central banks can keep acting, but now it’s up to governments to step in.Big meetings and live entertainment are increasingly being canceled or going online, as states, cities and companies clamp down on big gatherings.New York indefinitely banned most gatherings of more than 500 people, a huge step that effectively meant the closure of Broadway theaters, Madison Square Garden and more. Cultural institutions like the Metropolitan Museum of Art independently decided to close.Airlines are buckling under the strain, especially after President Trump’s ban on most visitors from Europe. The discount airline Norwegian said it would furlough half its staff, and most major American airlines capped fares and suspended change fees for many European itineraries.Disney said that it would close all its theme parks starting this weekend for the first time since the Sept. 11 attacks. (The company said employees would continue to be paid.) Princess Cruises, which suffered coronavirus outbreaks on two of its ships, suspended operations for 60 days. And many of the top late-night talks shows will go dark for at least two weeks.The sports world ramped up its responses. The N.C.A.A. canceled the men’s and women’s March Madness tournaments, Major League Baseball delayed the start of the 2020 season, the PGA golf tour shut down, and Formula One canceled its opening race. Pressure is mounting on pro soccer leagues to suspend matches after more teams entered quarantine.Virtual gatherings are on the rise, including online-only annual shareholder meetings and digital investor pitches for stock and debt offerings. (One exception: Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting in Omaha, which packs 16,000 people into the CenturyLink Arena, is still scheduled for May 2.)• Some activist investors criticize virtual-only shareholder meetings, saying they allow management teams to cherry pick softball questions and fend off troublesome attendees with the click of a mouse.• New York City’s pension funds were among these critics in the past. But in a statement to DealBook, the city’s comptroller, Scott Stringer, said that the funds he oversees “will not take action against boards holding virtual-only annual meetings due to the coronavirus that disclose their rationale and affirm their commitment to holding in-person meetings in the future.”In more coronavirus news:• Goldman Sachs is splitting many employees into “blue” and “white” teams who will alternate weeks at the office. (Business Insider)Updated May 26, 2020If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.Over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.There is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.Taking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.• Health experts worry that the roles women hold in society, such as nurses or caregivers, put them at greater risk of infection. (NYT)• The frenzy for new mortgages and refinancing is so high that some lenders are ignoring calls and raising rates to discourage new customers. (Bloomberg)The Japanese tech conglomerate announced this morning that it planned to buy back up to $4.8 billion of its stock. That’s likely to bring some cheer to Elliott Management, the activist investor pushing for change at the company — but only as a first step.Elliott has called for a buyback of as much as $20 billion, part of an effort to help raise the Japanese company’s market value. The hedge fund has also called for more independent directors on the SoftBank board and more transparency around the Vision Fund tech investment vehicle. (A representative for Elliott declined to comment.)The move didn’t do much to help SoftBank’s stock today, however. The company’s share price was down 5 percent after the announcement, as the broader Japanese market fell.Deals• Magic Leap, the maker of augmented reality goggles, is reportedly weighing a sale or fund-raising round, amid interest from Facebook and medical imaging companies.
