The Market Grapples With Fear and the Timing of a Recovery
By Conrad de AenlleA bull market that lasted more than a decade became a bear market in less than a month.The coronavirus was the catalyst, but not necessarily the cause. Maybe no one could have seen a pandemic coming, but stocks had reached valuations that suggested Wall Street thought nothing could ever go wrong.A few weeks later, the prevailing attitude seemed to be that nothing would ever be the same again. At least nothing good. The S&P 500 fell more than 35 percent from the closing high on Feb. 19 to the low on March 23. It lost 20 percent in the first quarter.But as the second quarter got going, the mood among traders grew less gloomy as virus infections approached or passed their peaks in hot spots like New York, Italy and Spain. Stocks remained well off their highs, but well off their lows, too, after a furious recovery. The S&P rose more than 25 percent from that March 23 low to April 14.Risk and uncertainty still abound. But while the short-term outlook — for investments, the economy and our physical and psychological well-being — is impossible to predict with assurance, many investment advisers believe they can glimpse a clearer picture the farther ahead they look.Highlights of mutual fund performance in the first quarter.Leaders and LaggardsStocks vs. BondsAmong general domestic stock funds.Average returns, by fund category.1ST QTR.12 MONTHSLEADERS1ST QTR.12 MONTHSMunicipal bonds––––1.94.821.622.1%+–––2.10.112.113.5%American FundsColllege 2024––––––––2.12.43.84.04.15.15.25.7%++–– +++3.66.80.81.3n/a0.21.61.3%Taxable bondsVitus Zevenb.Innov.

Cap ValueHotchkis & WileyMidcap ValueBy The New York Times | Source: Morningstar“I can’t tell you where we’re going to be three months from now, but I’m pretty confident about three years from now,” said Simeon Hyman, global investment strategist at ProShares.He foresees the world returning to a semblance of normality by then, with the stock market reflecting a recovery in physical and economic health. That’s why he recommends maintaining a normal, precrisis approach when it comes to managing portfolios, no matter how nerve-racking that might be.“Ordinary investors should stick to their discipline,” Mr. Hyman said. “Don’t sell into this. Sit on your hands. Continue your systematic investing to the extent you can.”He advised investors to rebalance portfolios to restore whatever preferred allocation they had to stocks and bonds before the bear market set in. For most people, that would mean selling some government bonds, which have risen in value, and buying stocks, which certainly have not.Matthew Benkendorf, co-manager of the Virtus Vontobel Global Opportunities fund, also advised rebalancing and staying the course, no matter how bumpy the trip might be.“I wouldn’t take money out of the stock market,” he said, admonishing against “the classic pitfall of capitulation.”Looking for silver linings in an otherwise dark cloud, Mr. Benkendorf identified “some good things about this.” One is that “the government is showing up as it needs to show up,” he said. “They got the checkbook out.”Congress appropriated $2 trillion in March for the largest economic rescue package ever. The bill included cash payments to individuals, enhanced unemployment benefits and loans to businesses that contain incentives to retain as many workers as possible.The Federal Reserve has been doing its part, too. It cut short-term interest rates to close to zero percent in March, pledged to buy unlimited amounts of Treasury bonds and other debt instruments, and offered nearly unlimited credit to banks.Ordinary investors bought a fair amount of Treasury bonds in the first quarter, and almost nothing else. Long-term government bond funds rose 21.9 percent, according to Morningstar. But the average bond fund overall lost 4.8 percent, mainly because of plunges in portfolios focusing on riskier issues, such as high-yield and emerging market debt, each of which fell more than 10 percent. The average domestic stock fund was off 21.5 percent in the quarter. Portfolios that concentrate on economically sensitive industrial companies, financial services and energy did worse than most. Health care and technology held up better, but no funds in the main sectors made money. International stock funds dropped 22.1 percent, with specialists in Latin America, India and Europe performing especially poorly. It may be hard to tell with the stock market rising or falling several percent on many days, but Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management, thinks Wall Street has reacted sensibly to Covid-19.“There’s a feeling that the market is panicking,” he said. “The market is, I’m afraid, behaving quite rationally. There is huge joblessness. The decline we’ve seen, peak to trough, is appropriate. The market is pricing in a realistic scenario for economic growth in the U.S. and globally.”Mr. Paolini also thinks leaders in Washington are being sensible in their response to the crisis.“The good news is the unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus — a 50 percent bigger stimulus than 2008-9,” during the global financial crisis, he said. “I really think the policy response is appropriate for the decline in economic growth.”A dilemma for investors who sold stocks is that if they don’t buy them back until the virus — and an almost certain recession — have been subdued, they might forgo substantial gains.“You don’t add risk to your portfolio when the economy is positive. You act when it stops deteriorating,” Mr. Paolini said. Signs of that would be “positive news flow regarding the virus,” such as a lower infection rate, more testing or the deployment of a test for antibodies to identify people who have recovered from an infection and are therefore likely immune.At this point, much bad news is priced into stocks, he said, including a 35 percent drop in dividend payments. He anticipates a 30 percent decline in earnings per share, which he called “bad, but not catastrophic.”Analysts have been sprinting to slash their forecasts for economic and corporate performance. Leading indicators tracked by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development recorded “the largest drop on record in most major economies” in March, the group said.Investment banks have continually revised their predictions for declines in second-quarter economic output, with those of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley approaching a 40 percent annual rate. As for earnings, FactSet Research foresees the companies in the S&P 500 collectively experiencing a 21.7 percent decline in the second quarter, compared to the same quarter of 2019. Its full-year forecast is for a 9 percent decline.Bear markets often unfold slowly because investors are unsure whether a recession is approaching. James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, argues that there is no such uncertainty now — so it’s possible that the selling that typically occurs has already happened in this one.Updated May 26, 2020If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.Over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.There is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.Taking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco, highlighted two aspects of the crisis with opposite potential impacts that she says have yet to be fully factored into share prices.“There’s a potential for slightly lower infection rates than had been expected,” she said, a development that was starting to be realized and could help account for the recovery since late March. But, she said, Wall Street has been expecting a sequel to the $2 trillion appropriation, and none has been announced. The absence of one “could be disastrous” for an economic recovery, she warned. Like Mr. Hyman and Mr. Benkendorf, Ms. Hooper encouraged investors to maintain the same mix of assets they aim for in more placid times. As for tactical moves, she would add exposure to Asian emerging markets, including China.“Valuations are relatively attractive, and they’re on the other side of the crisis or have made it through relatively unscathed,” she said.She also likes emerging-market debt and investment-grade corporate bonds, but is wary of high-yield debt and considers Treasury issues overvalued.By Mr. Paolini’s estimate, the battering in stocks left them at levels that could produce long-term returns of about 10 percent a year. Because Treasury bond yields are so low — the 10-year bond yielded 0.7 percent at the end of March — and because all that fiscal stimulus and Fed balance sheet expansion could produce inflation, he expects stocks to greatly outperform bonds over the long haul.Which stocks he would own depends on the shape of the economic recovery. A sharp, V-shaped one should allow cyclical sectors like industrials and energy to outperform, while technology and pharmaceutical companies should do better in a slower recovery.Mr. Paolini also likes emerging markets. But with trade possibly waning in the post-Covid-19 world, he favors ones with big domestic economies like China and Indonesia.Mr. Hyman suggested expanding into foreign stocks to increase diversification, and he would reduce the average maturity in bond portfolios to limit risk. Another way to play defense, he said, is to own higher-quality companies with “long track records of growing dividends and stable earnings growth.”Some examples in his firm’s S&P 500 Aristocrats exchange-traded fund are Johnson & Johnson, Caterpillar, Target and Procter & Gamble.Mr. Benkendorf recommends adding exposure to “phenomenal businesses outside the U.S.,” including stocks of Asian technology companies and “high-quality consumer staples companies in Europe that are often better than U.S. companies.”Examples of the first sort are Alibaba and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. His preferred European consumer issues include Unilever and Rentokil.Whatever tinkering investors do with their portfolios, Mr. Benkendorf encourages them not to think too much about the stock market these days.“You have to practice a fair amount of benign neglect,” he said.When investors do think about the market, they should think positively.
