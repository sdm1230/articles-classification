A Failure of Policy and Planning
 The goal of “opening up” the U.S. economy by April 12 didn’t last long — social-distancing guidelines have been extended to April 30. (Want this in your inbox each morning?

But when the coronavirus crisis required ramping factories to make ventilators, “the White House’s ability to gather the power of American industry crumpled,” the NYT’s David Sanger and Maggie Haberman write.Automakers have retooled plants to build ventilators, but received mixed messages from the administration, which last week invoked emergency powers to compel the production of the lifesaving machines. Mr. Trump criticized G.M. and Ford for perceived delays on Friday, before praising them on Sunday.• G.M. partnered with Ventec, a ventilator specialist, to accelerate production by using the carmaker’s plant in Indiana. The two were deep in round-the-clock preparations when Mr. Trump accused the carmaker’s C.E.O., Mary Barra, of “wasting time.”• Worry over getting on the president’s bad side, the NYT’s Neal Boudette and Andrew Jacobs report, has made other executives think twice about volunteering their resources “for fear of ending up becoming targets for Mr. Trump as Ms. Barra had.”It didn’t have to be this way, according to the NYT’s Nicholas Kulish, Sarah Kliff and Jessica Silver-Greenberg. A government contract for about 40,000 ventilators, created in 2008, got bogged down after the winning bidder was acquired by a large medical device manufacturer (which itself was acquired later by a rival). The lesson, according to the NYT:“The stalled efforts to create a new class of cheap, easy-to-use ventilators highlight the perils of outsourcing projects with critical public-health implications to private companies; their focus on maximizing profits is not always consistent with the government’s goal of preparing for a future crisis.”This isn’t a uniquely American problem. The British government’s ventilator-purchase plans are also in disarray. The C.E.O. of Germany’s Drägerwerk, one of the world’s largest ventilator manufacturers, told the FT that he was “skeptical” of non-specialists’ ability to ramp up production of the machines. He also worries about a shortage of supplies as demand soars around the world.• When the crisis subsides, the scramble to build ventilators will provide plenty of material for studies about how to better align public policy with corporate planning.Washington is prepared to spend trillions on helping the country recover from the pandemic. That has lobbyists and influence peddlers pressing for some of the money, the NYT’s Ken Vogel writes.Companies are clamoring to certify their products for use in the coronavirus response. The maker of Lysol, Reckitt Benckiser, for instance, pushed for provisions in the just-passed relief package that expedite approval for virus-killing disinfectants. And the company NanoPure has hired a top Trump fund-raiser to get approval for a spray disinfectant for use on airplanes. (Some political operatives have even started their own medical supply businesses.)K Street is gearing up, Ken writes. The lobbying firm Holland & Knight has set up a “Covid-19 response team” that’s expected to grow to up to 60 lawyers, and has been working on behalf of the battery maker Energizer, a hotel industry company and clients in the paper and chemical sectors. Lee Weingart of the LNE Group, another lobbying shop, said his firm was “busier now than we’ve been.”At the same time, companies are continuing to donate money and supplies to the response effort.Google announced $800 million in credits and investments on Friday, including $250 million in ad grants to the W.H.O. and other government agencies, and a $200 million investment fund to assist nonprofits and lenders with efforts to help small businesses. It’s also working with a supplier to produce two million to three million face masks for the C.D.C. Foundation.• We’ve noted before how tech companies like Apple and Facebook are helping, in terms of money and supplies.Meanwhile, big-name philanthropists shared their advice with the NYT’s Paul Sullivan. Among the tips from donors like Mike Bloomberg and Connie Ballmer: Give to community foundations that have the expertise and resources to vet charities; act as bridges for government funding; and be flexible with your rules — this is a crisis, after all.The investment bank Jefferies announced yesterday that its C.F.O., Peg Broadbent, died over the weekend from complications of Covid-19. He was the first senior Wall Street casualty of the coronavirus.Mr. Broadbent, 56, had been at Jefferies since 2007, making him one of Wall Street’s longest-serving C.F.O.s. The bank’s C.E.O., Rich Handler, and president, Brian Friedman, praised him for helping to “build Jefferies from less than half its current size, and navigate through hard times and good times.”His death highlights the importance of succession plans, Bloomberg’s Jeff Green notes. And it isn’t just C-suite positions that need consideration, Mr. Green notes: “Increasingly important are roles such as supply-chain managers, who might not have been as front-and-center in earlier plans.”In other coronavirus news:• Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the top government officials leading the coronavirus response, is now a target online for the far right after he corrected some of Mr. Trump’s claims.

(Bloomberg)🛍 Tuesday: Consumer confidence data for March is expected to show a big drop — but the surveys conducted by the Conference Board covered the early part of the month, before many lockdowns.📅 Wednesday: The first of the month is when many rent payments and other bills are due. Without leeway from lenders and landlords, the squeeze on people and businesses may be too much to bear.📄 Thursday: Initial U.S. unemployment claims set a record last week, at 3.3 million, and this week’s data is expected to be just as bad — or worse.💊 Thursday: Walgreens reports its latest quarterly earnings, which could get a boost from shoppers stocking up on medicines and other health-related products.📉 Friday: Monthly payrolls data for March are likely to show the first fall in jobs in nearly 10 years. But because the bulk of job losses came later in the month, it won’t reflect the full extent of the decline.Updated May 26, 2020If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.Over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.There is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.Taking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.🍻 Friday: Constellation Brands, which sells Corona beer in the U.S., is expected to report a hit to earnings.Deals• Activist shareholders like Elliott Management are easing up on campaigns to pressure corporate boards during the coronavirus crisis.
