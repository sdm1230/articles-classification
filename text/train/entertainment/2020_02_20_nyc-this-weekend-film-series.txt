4 Film Series to Catch in N.Y.C. This Weekend
By Ben KenigsbergOur guide to film series and special screenings happening this weekend and in the week ahead. All our movie reviews are at nytimes.com/reviews/movies.CLIMATE CRISIS PARABLES at the Metrograph (Feb. 22-April 22). Movies have sounded the alarm bell about climate change for more than 50 years. This retrospective reaches back as far as Michelangelo Antonioni’s first color film, the “Silent Spring”-era “Red Desert” (on Feb. 29), in which the malaise suffered by Monica Vitti’s character deepens against a backdrop of chemical pollution so thick you can scarcely breathe. The writer and activist Naomi Klein will appear at Sunday’s screening of Hayao Miyazaki’s environmentally minded parable “Princess Mononoke.” And in the 2011 film “Melancholia” (also on Sunday), Lars von Trier proposes that a world-ending cataclysm would at least bring relief to those already in despair.212-660-0312, metrograph.com‘EL CORAZÓN Y LA ESPADA’ IN 3-D at Film Forum (Feb. 23, 12:50 p.m.). The 3-D fad of the 1950s wasn’t exclusively a Hollywood phenomenon. Film Forum will screen a restored version of Mexico’s first stereoscopic feature, a swashbuckler shown in the United States as “Sword of Granada” and starring Cesar Romero and Katy Jurado.212-727-8110, filmforum.org[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]HAPPY BIRTHDAY, TONI!
