‘Saturday Night Live’ Halts Its Season
By Dave Itzkoff“Saturday Night Live” became the latest topical comedy series to suspend its season amid concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. “S.N.L.,” the late-night NBC variety sketch program, had been on a scheduled hiatus after its March 7 broadcast and was expected to return on March 28. But the series “will now not resume production until further notice,” NBC said in a statement on Monday. The network added, “We will monitor the situation closely and make decisions about future shows on an ongoing basis as further information develops.”“S.N.L.,” which is currently in its 45th season and is broadcast from NBC’s New York headquarters at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, joins the ranks of other programs like “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” “Late Night With Seth Meyers” and “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” which have all halted their seasons during the spread of the coronavirus.
