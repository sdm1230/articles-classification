‘Timmy Failure: Mistakes Were Made’ Review: Kid Sleuth on the Case
Tom McCarthy’s new film goes inside a boy’s imagination, but not interestingly or with charm.By Kyle TurnerWhen you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In “Timmy Failure: Mistakes Were Made,” streaming on Disney Plus and based on the first book in Stephan Pastis’s children’s series, the amateur gumshoe Timmy (Winslow Fegley) uses a gargantuan vocabulary to indicate his precocity, his work as a detective tantamount to his sense of self. As he runs a little agency out of the cramped home he shares with his two-job-juggling single mother and a C.G.I. polar bear named Total as his sidekick, “normal is for normal people” becomes one of his mantras to explain his idiosyncrasies.The elementary-schooler would probably be at home in a Dashiell Hammett novel on the trail of a chocolate Maltese Falcon, as he speaks semi-exclusively in detective/cop dialogue, saying things like, “affirmative,” asking about Russian operatives (read: Portland hipsters) and repeating his other mantra: “Mistakes were made.” When a backpack goes missing, a hamster turns up dead and the “Failure Mobile” (his mother’s Segway) disappears, Timmy Failure is on the case, an imagined Holmesian intuition on hand.Yet, in spite of the cutesy little mystery threads that the film initially begins weaving, the director Tom McCarthy’s focus is more on the boy’s outsider status. His grades are bad, his family is lower income, the kids at school think he’s weird and he easily exasperates adults. The film could have contrasted the absurdities of Timmy’s world with the reality around him by using the clichés of film noir to create a smoky, illusive fantasy, while occasionally popping that bubble, like in Rian Johnson’s high school-set mystery “Brick.” Instead, it prefers outsized “30 Rock”-like asides that illustrate Timmy’s imagination straightforwardly, but not interestingly or with charm.There isn’t enough in the way of good jokes or clever references to investigators of yore to make the film appealing, and the flatness of Timmy’s delivery, which is supposed to scan as deadpan, doesn’t contain enough nuances to make much of the humor land. Maybe in a few years, the detective can dive into another mystery that deserves to be solved.Timmy Failure: Mistakes Were Made
