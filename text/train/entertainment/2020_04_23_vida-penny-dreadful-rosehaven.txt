The sisters Lyn and Emma (played by Melissa Barrera and Mishel Prada) are kind of getting along, which they both sense can’t last, and they deal with that in different ways, Lyn by squeezing harder and Emma by pulling away. Characters on “Vida” are very up in each other’s business, which is one reason this show is so good at rich, complicated interpersonal conflict: Everyone starts from a place of You think you know me so well, but you don’t.‘Penny Dreadful: City of Angels’When to watch: Sunday 10:10 p.m., on Showtime.This spinoff of the horror series “Penny Dreadful” moves the festivities to 1938 Los Angeles, where it takes on a little of everything: Nazis, Mexican mysticism, politics, racism, evangelism, demons, cop stuff, old cars that make funny noises, you name it. Natalie Dormer anchors the show as a creepy shape-shifter, and she’s flanked by strong performances from Adam Rodriguez, Rory Kinnear, Michael Gladis, Kerry Bishé and Nathan Lane among others. It’s possible the show has bitten off more than it can chew, but then again, demons can chew an awful lot.‘Rosehaven’When to watch: Now, on SundanceNow or with a Sundance add-on on Amazon.
