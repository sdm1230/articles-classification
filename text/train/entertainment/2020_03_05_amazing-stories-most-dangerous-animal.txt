How Much Watching Time Do You Have This Weekend?
By Margaret LyonsNo matter how much free time you have this weekend, we have TV recommendations for you. Come back every week for new suggestions on what to watch.‘Amazing Stories’When to watch: Starting Friday, on Apple TV Plus.This revived anthology series, based on the 1980s original created by Steven Spielberg, tells a stand-alone, often supernatural story every week. Only the first episode was made available to critics for review: a pleasant time-travel romance, like a diet “Twilight Zone” in a good way. Victoria Pedretti and Dylan O’Brien play sweethearts from differing time periods who are brought together by a freakish storm and magical barometric pressure. If you wish movies were shorter, watch this.‘The Most Dangerous Animal of All’When to watch: Friday at 8 p.m., on FX.FX is airing all four episodes of this documentary back to back, and thank goodness — it’s highly bingeable, and the fourth episode is essential to recontextualizing the story. Gary L. Stewart was adopted in infancy, and as an adult he connected with his biological mother. Based on what she told him, Stewart began to believe that his biological father was the Zodiac Killer, and he wrote a popular book about his own investigation. But this is far less about the Zodiac Killer than about a quest for meaning, our attempts, however misguided, to make sense our lives. (All four parts arrive on Hulu Saturday.)‘Thief’When to watch: Now, on Hulu.
