By Sara AridiLESLIE JONES: TIME MACHINE (2020) Stream on Netflix. Leslie Jones left “Saturday Night Live” last fall. But that doesn’t mean she’s not keeping busy. The 52-year old comedian just announced that she will be hosting a reboot of the game show “Supermarket Sweep” on ABC. And she has this new stand-up special, directed by the “Game of Thrones” creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss. In this performance, Jones lists the ups and downs of aging and argues that today’s 20-year-olds don’t know how to have fun. To prove her point, she roasts a young audience member for her subdued outfit choice, calling it a “Little House on the Prairie” sweater.THE BLACK STALLION (1979) Stream on Criterion; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube.
