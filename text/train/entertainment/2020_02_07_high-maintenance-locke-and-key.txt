How Much Watching Time Do You Have This Weekend?
By Margaret LyonsNo matter how much free time you have this weekend, we have TV recommendations for you. Come back every week for new suggestions on what to watch.‘High Maintenance’When to watch: Friday at 11 p.m., on HBOSeason 4 of TV’s most wistful show is here, bringing tenderness and brief mercies along with its weed deliveries. Ben Sinclair returns as “The Guy,” biking around New York City and thus crossing paths — or almost crossing paths — with all kinds of interesting folks. In the season premiere, that includes the staff of “This American Life,” which feels both overdue and somehow redundant. If you like either of those shows, there’s a 99 percent chance you will like the other one. This isn’t my favorite episode of “High Maintenance,” but it is always fun to put radio names with actual faces.‘Gavin & Stacey’When to watch: Now, on CW Seed, Hulu, Amazon or BritBoxThis sweet, low-concept British comedy from 2007, which follows an eager couple through their courtship, is now streaming for free on CW Seed. While Gavin and Stacey themselves are relatively normal, they’re flanked by quirky supporting characters, like their BFFs Smithy and Nessa (played by the show’s creators, James Corden and Ruth Jones) and oddball family members. If you like grounded rom-coms and need a beacon of comfort, watch this. Note that for now, at least, the 2019 Christmas special is available only on BritBox.‘Locke & Key’When to watch: Now, on Netflix
