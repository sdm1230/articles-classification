The Australia Wildfires in Pictures
Supported byBy The New York TimesFlames have blackened an area the size of Guatemala, destroyed some 2,000 homes and killed at least 28 people in one of the worst wildfire seasons in Australian history. More than 200 blazes are still burning, many of them completely uncontrolled.On Saturday, Victoria’s Forest Fire Management confirmed on Twitter that one of its firefighters had died while working on a bushfire near Omeo. On Friday, two of the biggest infernos merged into what officials called a “mega-fire,” straddling the country’s two hardest-hit and most populous states, New South Wales and Victoria.Steady winds continue to drive the flames, but the record-breaking heat that made conditions worse last month and into the new year has abated, and the possibility of at least a little rain next week entered the forecast.The fire season began early this year, in September, enabled by heat, wind and drought that had left trees and brush tinder dry. The blazes grew steadily worse and have consumed more than 41,000 square miles so far, spreading a harmful shroud of smoke across much of southeastern Australia, and even touching some suburbs of Sydney, the most populous city.Here is a look at some of the most powerful images of the fires and the devastation they have left behind, the people and animals attempting to escape them, and the continuing effort to contain them.Burned forest near Mallacoota, Victoria.A C27 Spartan aircraft flying over an area near Mallacoota hit by a bushfire.A destroyed house in Mallacoota.Evacuees and their pets from Mallacoota at the Royal Australian Air Force base in Sale.Trevor Stewart, a Rural Fire Service firefighter, in Tumburumba, New South Wales.A dehydrated and underfed wild horse was stumbling and close to collapse in the Bago State forest.Rural Fire Service trucks refilling their water tanks as the Dunns Road fire increased in ferocity.A helicopter flying low over the Dunns Road fire dropped water on the advancing blaze.Mark Bourke, left, and Greg Lyons, members of the Rural Fire Service, near Maragle.
