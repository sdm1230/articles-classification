Sinkhole in China Swallows a Bus, Killing at Least 6 
By Tiffany MayHONG KONG â€” At least six people have been killed and more are missing after a bus plunged into a sinkhole in the city of Xining, in northwestern China. Video footage circulating on Chinese social media on Monday shows several people waiting to board the bus in Xining, the capital of Qinghai Province, when a traffic sign wobbles and the vehicle begins to sink into the road. Bystanders rushed to help passengers escape from the sinkhole, which was at least 32 feet in diameter, according to Chinese state media, but they backed away as the bus slipped further into the widening hole. Rescue crews worked overnight to free trapped passengers. Local business owners said they tried to help by breaking the bus windows to reach passengers. Officials in Xining said Tuesday morning that 10 people were missing and 15 more injured. Sinkholes can be caused by natural erosion or acidic rainwater that weakens sedimentary rock. Similar accidents in China in recent years were thought to stem from construction projects.  A sinkhole in the southeastern city of Xiamen in December swallowed three cars. That same month, three people fell into a sinkhole near a subway line under construction in Guangzhou, in southern China.
